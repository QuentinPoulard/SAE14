<p class="texttloisir"> I have many hobbies and many passions. The main ones are first of all my family as well as my friends because they are the ones who are always present.<br>
<br> I also did a lot of club sports such as Judo, Football and Tenis. Today I prefer to do my side with bodybuilding and with general outings.
<br><br> One of my great passion is also Video Games. I really like team games with communication like Raimbow Siw Siege and Rocket League
<br> I also like everything related to computers and new technologies. For example at the moment I spend time with my father informing me about web 3.0 and blockchain as well as cryptocurrency which will be even more present for me in the future.
